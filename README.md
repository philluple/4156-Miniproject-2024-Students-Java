COMS-4156-MiniProject
This is the GitHub repo for the Miniproject for Advanced Software Engineering. 

Building and Running a Local Instance

Maven 3.9.9: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Download and follow the installation instructions, be sure to set the bin as described in Maven's README as a new path variable by editing the system variables if you are on windows or by following the instructions for MacOS.

JDK 20.0.1: This project used JDK 20.0.1 for development.

This code was developed on MacOS, so these are the instructions for developing on the same platform with the same tools mentioned above. One can either fork or clone this repo, navigate to /IndividualProject, and the command: mvn clean install. This command will install all dependencies and packages neccessary for developing and testing a local instance. 

For consistency with the rest of the code, I reccoment periodically running the  mvn checkstyle:check or mvn checkstyle:checkstyle if you wish to generate the report. 

To check code coverage, you can run  `mvn clean verify` which will generate an html report which can be found in `/IndividualProject/target/site/dev.coms4156.project.individualproject/index.html`, open that file with a browser or any HTML viewer to verify that code coverage is maintained to a reasonable threshold. 

Running a Cloud based Instance
For a short time you'll be able to reach our service by the magic of cloud computing here is what you need to do:

When running tests in Postman point them to: http:// 34.86.161.172 /endpoint
For example and to see if the cloud service is still operational please see if the following displays "Connection is Successful" http://34.86.161.172/test-connectivity
If the above produced "Connection is Successful" that means the service is operational via the cloud, you are still welcome to make your own instance locally as per the instructions above!
Happy Hacking!
Running Tests
Our unit tests are located under the directory 'src/test'. To run our project's tests in IntelliJ using Java 17, you must first build the project.

From there, you can right-click any of the classes present in the src/test directory and click run to see the results.

To see our system-level tests, see the section "Postman Test Documentation" below.

Postman Test Documentation
View the list of API calls made over the network using post man fully documented with the received result and parameters: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/30499865/2s9YR85tUY

Specific Tests confirming proper returning of HTTP status codes and content types are ran during Continuous Integration as well.

Endpoints
This section describes the endpoints that our service provides, as well as their inputs and outputs. See the "Postman Test Documentation" section for in-depth examples of use cases and inputs/outputs, especially for file uploads and downloads. To see more information on the method level specific api via javadoc and also to access what exceptions could be thrown visit: https://griffinnewbold.github.io/javaindex Any malformed request such that there is an error in your wording i.e. you do not use %20 for a space, or such that the API endpoint structure does not match what you are attempting to send you will receive a HTTP 400 Bad Request in response.

Style Checking Report
We used the tool "checkstyle" to check the style of our code and generate style checking reports. Here is the report as of the day of 11/30/23 (These can be found in the reports folder):

Screenshot of a checkstyle with no errors Second Screenshot of a checkstyle with no errors

Branch Coverage Reporting
We used JaCoCo to perform branch analysis in order to see the branch coverage of the relevant code within the code base. See below for screenshots demonstrating output.

Screenshot of a code coverage report from the plugin

Static Code Analysis
We used PMD to perform static analysis on our codebase, see below for the most recent output.

Screenshot of PMD analysis report

A report of from November 30 is present but is outdated as the image above is from December 1st. We made the decision to not include issues from priority levels 4 and 5 as PMD states (https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_userdocs_configuring_rules.h) these are medium-low and low risks respectively. All of the Priority 5 issues that were displayed on the full report were false positives at best and disgruntled differences on variable placement at worst and has no effect on the execution of the service, while priority 4 was similar these were relatively few in number such that they were fixed.

Continuous Integration Report
This repository using GitHub Actions to perform continous integration, to view the latest results go to the following link: https://github.com/griffinnewbold/COMS-4156-Service/actions/workflows/maven.yml

Click on the latest job on the top under "X workflow runs" then Click 'build' under jobs finally click the drop down next to all the action items to read the logs made during their execution

For convenience a recent CI Report has been manually created and is available for view in the reports directory under the appropriately named file.

An Initial Note to Developers
If you are reading this then you would consider yourself a developer and you may also have a slight interest in developing your own app that uses the service provided in the given repository. Well in order to do so you would need to develop a project with a backend capable of communicating with our API, many languages offer different libraries capable of making HTTP requests of different kinds. You'd want to make sure that you are hosting the service on your own hardware/server rather than relying on any of the non local resources that may influence the results of your own app, this is especially true since our project does not utilize docker containers. But you while you could clone this repository into the same directory as your app and make a monlith, we'd personally recommend against it. It can lead to confusion on what resources you are working with and need to update especially for more novice developers, separate directories make the process much simplier. If you wish to continue with the process of developing an app, please view the instructions for building, testing, and running a local instance above, and then check out the sister repository linked above and view it for how a client app could look that makes use of this service, finally view the section of the README titled: "A Final Note to Developers". An important note for both the service and client app, since they both rely on Firebase as the persistent storage option, you will need to provide your own configuration file in the directory containing the build file, for maven it would be the pom.xml file. To make your own database and config file, go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and create your own project. Upon creation, navigate to Project Settings > Service Accounts and click "Generate a new private key" the file that downloads will be the file needed, it should be named "firebase_config.json" for proper use with our service, you should alter the value provided as a parameter in FirebaseConfig.java in the setDatabaseUrl() method and pass in the link to your database rather than ours assuming you wish to have your own separate database instance for your version of the service.

Tools used 🧰
This section includes notes on tools and technologies used in building this project, as well as any additional details if applicable.

Firebase DB
Maven Package Manager
GitHub Actions CI
This is enabled via the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
Currently, this just runs a Maven build to make sure the code builds on branch 'main'.
Checkstyle
We use Checkstyle for code reporting. Note that Checkstyle does NOT get run as part of the CI pipeline.
For running Checkstyle manually, you can use the "Checkstyle-IDEA" plugin for IntelliJ.
PMD
We are using PMD to do static analysis of our Java code.
Originally we were planning on using SonarQube, however we did not do this as it requires us to either pay or setup a server to host a SonarQube instance.
JUnit
JUnit tests get run automatically as part of the CI pipeline.
JaCoCo
We use JaCoCo for generating code coverage reports.
Originally we were planning on using Cobertura, however Cobertura does not support our version of Java.
Postman
We used Postman for testing that the APIs work.
Third Party API Documentation
We made extensive use of Firebase Realtime Database provided by Google for both the service portion and the app portion of the project, here is a link to the full documentation provided by Google on how to use the different components provided and gives insight into how we managed the development of this project while making use of it: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/
